# CHANGELOG

Refer to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for guidelines on how to create a good changelog.

Note that the notion of a "changelog" (or of "release notes") is a common practice for projects with well establised releases, but is harder to adopt when using continuous deployment. You may need to adapt the guidelines above if that is your case.
