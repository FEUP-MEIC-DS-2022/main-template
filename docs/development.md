# Development

## Architecture overview

Describe the architecture and design of the system. Use component/deployment diagrams. If needed, resort to package diagrams to organize them into more manageable parts.

Be clear about what is the current architecture/design and what is the one you envision in the future, in case they are different. 
Identify main risks and justify the most important choices to show the soundness of the architecture and design that you have implemented or plan to implement.


## Technology

Identify the main technologies, languages and frameworks used. Clearly identify which ones were restrictions imposed by the client and which were your own choices. Justify your choices and explain in your own words the motivation for the restrictions of your client.

Explain the prototype or base implementation that you have implemented in Sprint 0, and how that has informed the rest of the development.


##  Development guide

Explain what a new developer to the project should know in order to develop the system, including who to build, run and test it in a development environment. 

Document any APIs, formats and protocols needed for development (but don't forget that public APIs should also be accessible from the "How to use" section in your README.md file).

Describe coding conventions and other guidelines adopted by the project.


## Security concerns

Identify potential security vulnerabilities classes and explain what the team has done to mitigate them.


## Quality assurance

Describe which tools are used for quality assurance and link to relevant resources. Namely, provide access to reports for coverage and mutation analysis, static analysis, and other tools that may be used for QA.
